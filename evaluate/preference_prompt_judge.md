You have received the following question at a supercomputing support center:

<question>
{QUESTION}
</question>

You have also been provided with the following documentation to help answer the question:

<documentation>
{DOCUMENTATION}
</documentation>

Two potential answers to the question have been drafted:

Answer #1:
<answer1>
{ANSWER1}
</answer1>

Answer #2: 
<answer2>
{ANSWER2}
</answer2>

Your task is to determine which of the two answers is better, based on the following criteria:

- An answer should directly address the user's question. 
- An answer should be clear and concise, not overly verbose.
- An answer should only use information present in the provided documentation. It should not include any information or claims that cannot be supported by the documentation.
- If the question cannot be satisfactorily answered using only the provided documentation, it should not be answered at all.

Carefully analyze both answers against the above criteria and write out your thought process and reasoning for which answer better meets the criteria. Remember, do not actually answer the original question yourself. You are only choosing between the two provided answers based on how well they meet the specified criteria. Rely only on the provided documentation in your evaluation.
